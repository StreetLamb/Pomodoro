# Pomodoro
Pomodoro IOS app to increase your productivity!

The Pomodoro app allows users to input the tasks to be completed for the day, and it will then show the estimated number of Pomodoros and the time to complete all the tasks. The timer will then countdown and send notifications to users to take a break and start working again.

Built with SwiftUI.

# DEMO
Timer countdown reduced to only a few seconds for demo purposes.
